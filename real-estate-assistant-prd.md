| 3.2 | Location-specific guidance | As a user, I want advice tailored to the tenancy laws in my specific region. | System should adjust responses based on jurisdiction when location is provided. | Implement location detection and maintain region-specific legal databases. |
| 3.3 | Legal disclaimer provision | As a user, I want to understand the limitations of the advice provided. | System should clearly indicate it's providing general guidance, not legal advice. | Add appropriate disclaimers to responses involving legal matters. |
| 3.4 | Landlord/tenant perspective toggle | As a user, I want responses that consider my role as either a tenant or landlord. | System should adapt responses based on the user's stated role in the tenancy relationship. | Implement role-based response templates with appropriate perspective shifts. |
| 3.5 | Document explanation capability | As a user, I want help understanding sections of my lease or tenancy agreement. | System should be able to interpret common lease clauses and explain their implications. | Create a specialized tool for lease analysis with common clause recognition. |
| **4. User Experience & Interface** |
| 4.1 | Intuitive chat interface | As a user, I want a simple, easy-to-use interface for interacting with the system. | Interface should be clean, responsive, and clearly indicate when I can upload images. | Develop responsive UI with clear visual cues for multimodal input options. |
| 4.2 | Conversation history persistence | As a user, I want to reference previous parts of my conversation. | System should maintain and display conversation history within a session. | Implement session management using Agno's memory capabilities. |
| 4.3 | Response formatting optimization | As a user, I want information presented in an easily digestible format. | System should use appropriate formatting (lists, bold text, etc.) to enhance readability. | Enable markdown formatting in agent responses (supported by Agno). |
| 4.4 | Visual indicators for agent switching | As a user, I want to know which specialized agent is currently responding. | Interface should subtly indicate which agent is active in the conversation. | Implement visual cues in the UI when router switches between agents. |
| **5. Technical Requirements** |
| 5.1 | Performance optimization | As a user, I want quick response times, even for image analysis. | System should respond within acceptable timeframes (< 5 seconds for text, < 10 seconds for images). | Leverage Agno's "lightning fast" architecture and optimize image processing pipeline. |
