                - 14-60 days after tenant moves out (varies by location)

                - New York: 14 days
                - Florida: 15-60 days depending on whether tenant disputes deductions
                
                ## Allowable Deductions
                
                Landlords can typically deduct from security deposits for:
                
                1. Unpaid rent
                2. Damage beyond normal wear and tear
                3. Excessive cleaning costs
                4. Unpaid utilities

                ## Tenant Rights
                
                Tenants generally have rights to:
                
                1. A detailed itemized statement of deductions
                2. Receipts for repairs or cleaning costs
