# Tenant Rights in the United States

## Core Federal Protections

All tenants in the United States are protected by federal laws regardless of state or local jurisdiction:

1. **Fair Housing Act**: Prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.

2. **Americans with Disabilities Act**: Requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities.

3. **Fair Credit Reporting Act**: Regulates how landlords can use credit information for screening tenants.

4. **Service Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA)**: Provides protections for active duty military members, including lease termination rights.

## Essential Tenant Rights

Across most states, tenants generally have these fundamental rights:

### Habitability Rights

- Right to a habitable living space with working plumbing, electricity, heat, and structural integrity
- Protection from health hazards like lead paint, asbestos, or mold
- Access to essential services like trash removal and running water
- Functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors where required by law

### Privacy Rights

- Right to privacy and protection from unreasonable landlord entry
- Advance notice before landlord entry (typically 24-48 hours except in emergencies)
- Protection from landlord harassment or retaliation

### Financial Rights

- Clear written disclosure of all rental terms and fees
- Proper handling of security deposits with itemized deductions
- Protection from illegal rent increases during lease terms
- Right to withhold rent in certain circumstances when habitability is compromised (varies by jurisdiction)

### Eviction Protections

- Legal eviction proceedings must follow specific court processes
- Protection from "self-help" evictions (changing locks, removing possessions, utility shutoffs)
- Right to contest eviction in court
- Notice requirements before eviction proceedings (varies by state)

## Tenant Responsibilities

Tenants also have important responsibilities that balance their rights:

- Pay rent on time according to lease terms
- Maintain the property in a clean and undamaged condition
- Comply with lease provisions and building rules
- Allow reasonable access for repairs and inspections
- Notify landlord promptly about maintenance issues
- Not engage in illegal activity on the premises

## State-by-State Variations

While the above rights are generally consistent, specific protections vary significantly by state and sometimes by city. For example:

- Rent control or stabilization (limited to certain states/cities)
- Security deposit limits and return timeframes
- Specific notice periods for lease termination
- Repair and deduct remedies for maintenance issues
- Just cause eviction requirements

For specific state or local ordinances, tenants should consult the housing authority in their jurisdiction or seek legal advice.
