                ## During Fixed-Term Leases
                
                In most jurisdictions, landlords cannot increase rent during a fixed-term lease unless:
                
                1. The lease specifically allows for it
                2. The tenant agrees to the increase in writing
                3. There is a government-authorized increase
                
                ## For Month-to-Month Tenancies
                
                For month-to-month agreements, landlords typically must provide notice before increasing rent:
                
                - 30 days notice for increases under 10% (in many jurisdictions)
                - 60-90 days notice for larger increases (varies by location)
                
                ## Rent Control Areas
                
                Many cities have rent control or rent stabilization laws that limit:
                
                1. How much rent can be increased (often tied to inflation)
                2. How frequently increases can occur (typically once per year)
                3. What justifications are required for increases
                
                ## Best Practices for Tenants
                
                If you receive a rent increase notice:
                
                1. Check if it complies with local laws
                2. Verify proper notice was given
                3. Determine if your unit is subject to rent control
                4. Consider negotiating if the increase seems excessive
                5. Get any agreements in writing
