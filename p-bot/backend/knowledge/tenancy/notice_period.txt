                ## General Rules
                
                Most residential tenancies require the tenant to provide notice before moving out. The standard notice periods are:
                
                - Month-to-month tenancies: 30 days notice (in most jurisdictions)
                - Fixed-term leases: Notice typically not required if ending on the lease end date
                - Early termination: Usually requires landlord agreement or special circumstances
                
                ## Special Circumstances
                
                Some situations may allow for shorter notice periods:
                
                1. Domestic violence situations
                2. Military deployment
                3. Uninhabitable living conditions
                4. Health and safety violations
                
                ## Location-Specific Information
                
                Notice periods vary by location. Always check local laws. Some examples:
                
                - California: 30 days for tenancies less than 1 year, 60 days for longer tenancies
                - New York: 30 days notice for tenancies under 1 year
                - UK: Usually 1 month for monthly tenancies
                - Australia: Typically 14-28 days depending on the state
                
                ## Best Practices
                
                1. Always provide written notice
                2. Deliver notice according to methods specified in your lease
                3. Keep a copy of the notice and proof of delivery
                4. Be specific about your move-out date
