                ## Legal Grounds for Eviction
                
                Most jurisdictions require landlords to have legal cause for eviction, such as:
                
                1. Non-payment of rent
                2. Lease violations
                3. Property damage
                4. Illegal activities
                5. Expiration of lease (in some areas)
                6. Owner move-in (in some areas)
                
                ## Required Notice
                
                Landlords must provide written notice before beginning eviction proceedings:
                
                - Non-payment of rent: 3-10 days notice (varies by location)
                - Lease violations: 10-30 days notice to cure or vacate
                - No-fault evictions: 30-90 days notice (where permitted)
                
                ## The Legal Process
                
                Proper eviction requires:
                
                1. Written notice with specific reasons and timeframe
                2. Court filing if tenant doesn't comply with notice
                3. Court hearing where both parties can present their case
                4. Court judgment and order for eviction if landlord prevails
                5. Enforcement by sheriff/constable (not the landlord directly)
                
                ## Illegal Eviction Tactics
                
                Landlords CANNOT legally:
                
                1. Change locks without court order
                2. Remove tenant's belongings
                3. Shut off utilities
                4. Use threats or intimidation
                5. Remove doors or windows
                
                ## Tenant Defenses
                
                Possible defenses against eviction include:
                
                1. Improper notice or procedure
                2. Retaliation for reporting code violations
                3. Discrimination
                4. Acceptance of partial rent (in some cases)
                5. Failure to maintain habitable housing
