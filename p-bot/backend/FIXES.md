# Backend Fixes Summary

This document outlines all the issues found and fixed in the P-Bot backend.

## Dependency Issues

1. **Fixed syntax error in requirements.txt**
   - Changed `pandas=2.2.3` to `pandas==2.2.3`
   - Incorrect syntax would cause installation failures

## API Implementation Issues

1. **Memory Implementation**
   - Updated `AgentMemory` to `ThreadMemory` class in `base_agent.py`
   - The previous implementation used a non-existent class from the Agno framework

2. **Image Processing for OpenAI Models**
   - Updated image processing in `issue_detection_agent.py`
   - Changed the format of image data to match the format expected by OpenAI vision models
   - Now using the data URL format: `data:image/jpeg;base64,{img_base64}`

## Directory Structure Issues

1. **Directory Creation Logic**
   - Added proper directory creation for:
     - Upload directory for images
     - Knowledge directory for storing tenancy information
     - Vector DB directory for the LanceDB database
   - Used `os.makedirs` with `exist_ok=True` to ensure idempotent creation
   - Added directory checks to all agent initializations

2. **Improved Path Handling**
   - Updated main.py to use constants from config
   - Ensured consistent path handling across the application

## Error Handling Improvements

1. **Knowledge Loading**
   - Added robust error handling in knowledge loader
   - Prevented server crash when knowledge loading fails
   - Added informative error messages

2. **Agent Initialization**
   - Added more robust error handling during agent initialization
   - Improved logging for debugging issues

## Frontend-Backend Integration

1. **CORS and API Configuration**
   - Updated Vite configuration for proper API proxying
   - Added configuration for uploads directory access
   - Ensured secure CORS handling

## Testing and Verification

1. **Added Test Script**
   - Created `test_server.py` to verify backend functionality
   - Tests include:
     - Server connectivity
     - Chat API endpoints
     - Agent listing functionality

## Documentation Updates

1. **Updated Installation Guide**
   - Added instructions for installing the local Agno framework
   - Improved configuration documentation

By addressing these issues, the backend now follows best practices for error handling, directory management, and API implementation according to the Agno framework requirements.
